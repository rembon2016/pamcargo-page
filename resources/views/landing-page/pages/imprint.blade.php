                        A visit to our website can result in the storage on our server of information about the access (date, time, page accessed).

Any forwarding of the data to third parties without the express consent of the user shall not take place. We would like to expressly point out that the transmission of data via the Internet (e.g., by e-mail) can offer security vulnerabilities. It is therefore impossible to safeguard the data completely against access by third parties. We cannot assume any liability for damages arising because of such security vulnerabilities.

We reserve the right to take legal steps in the case of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, e.g., by means of spam mail.
